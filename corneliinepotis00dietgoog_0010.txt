Palalce,

In is not necessary here to defend the use of Nepos ae a school·
book. Much may be said both for and against it ; but there
can be no doubt thet, considering how universally the work
ie employed in education,a claesioal seriae euch ae the present
would have appeared imperfect had it not included an edition
of Nepos. The text here given isbosed upon that of Dr
Karl Nipperdey, as given in his school edition (Leipzigz 1849);
which text ie generally considered by scholare ae the best that
hae yet appeared. The texts of Bromi (3d edition; Zilrioh:
1820) and Tzeohuolre (Gottingenr 1804) have, however, been
oarefully compared, and their readings, where they differed from
Nipperdey, occasionally adopted. A valuable review by Hart-
mann of the school editione of Nipperdey and Siebelie, contained
in the Zeitaohrtyijitr die Alterttumewiaecnacltost for 1851, hae aleo
been consulted in the formation of the text. The fragments of
several vorke of Nepos, which have been collected from ancient
writers, are not included in this edition, because their hrevity,
unoonneatedness, and unsatisfactory character, render them quite
unsuitable for a school-book.

The notes are chiefly historica] and grammatical, and in the
early part of the book are more numerous than afterwarde; it
being believed that at the etage in the young student’s progress,
when Nepos ia put into hie hande,he might etumble even at some
of the minor difficulties of tha language. Bytho time, however,
that he hae advanced ae far ae the twelfth or thirteenth Life, he
may be presumed to ba well initiated into the style of the author,
and therefore to require lese aeeistance. In regard to the gram·
matioal portion of the notes, the editor hae derived great assistance
