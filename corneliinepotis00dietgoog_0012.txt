Vnnr little is kncvm of the pereoual history of Cornelius

Nepos, and the few facts with which we are acquainted, have
been gathered rather by inference, than from actual statements
iu ancient writers. In his life of Atticus (19), he speaks
of his having survived Atticus as a special dispensation cf
fortune. llrom this, as well aa from the great intimacy which
existed between the two—an intimacy of a kind scarcely con·
sistent with any great disparity of age—we may conclude that
Nepos was born about the same time as Atticus—109a.o. His
native district was that part of Cisalpina Gaul which the Insu-
brians inhabited, beyond the Po. He removed to Rome in early
life, and in all likelihood made that city his principal place oi
residence till his death, content with a small competence‚ spend-

cf peace and tranquillity, keeping himself entirely unconnected
with the political movements of that stirring and eventful epoch.
We gathan from a remark in one of Oicero’s letters to Atticus
(xvi. 14, 4), that Nepos lost a child by death about the year 44 ac,
when he must have been considerably advanced in life. His most
intimate friends seem to have been Atticus, who was undoubtedly
a man of very great learning, tacte, amiability, and virtue, though
the sketch of his character by Nepos is drawn with the peu of
an idolater rather than an admirer3 Cicero, the most eminent
philosopher and orator that Rome ever produced; and Catullus,
a poet of very high genius, who dedicated his collected poems to
cnr author. The exact period of the death of Nepos is uncertain.
We know that the latter part of the life ol Atticus was written
in or after the year 29 nc„ because in chapter 19, Octavianus is
styled imperator, which title was not conferred on him till that
year 3 auditis probable, ccnsideriug Nepos’s advanced age, that
he died shortly after. His character may be very easily seen
from his writings. He was a man of high moral excellence, and
hence in his biographies he constautly strives tc bring the virtues
