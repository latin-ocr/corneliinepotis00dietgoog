of his heroes into prominent view, considering their exploits in
war as but of secondary interest. His moral observatione are
almost always just, and often very beautiful. In intellectual
power he was merely respectable, not eminent ; and a conscious-
ness of this was probably one reason why ho never entered the
arena of political strife. He paid no great attention to philosophy,
partly because his mind was by nature averse to metaphysica
partly,as he says in a fragment which we have of a letter to Cicero
(Lactant. Irmtit. Dicin. iii. 15, 10), because he was disgusted with
the want of consistency between the precepts and the practice of
many teachers of ethical philosophy. Ιι historical researchcs,
however, he dclighted; and it was ιο historioal writing, partiou-
larly biography, that, as an author, he chiefly gave his attention.
One of his works was eutitled Chronico, and appears to have been
an epitome of universal history. It consisted of three books, which
the poet Catullus calls, more from courtesy perhaps than sincerity,
cltcrtoc dociae et laboriosae. Ιι this productim, he treated of the
mythical age at considerable length. Another of his works bore
the name of Exempla, and was probably a history of manners and
morals, especially among tha Romans. It consisted of at least five
books, since A. Gallinae writer of the second century after Ghrist,
quotes a passage from tho fifth book (vii.18,ll.) Such a work
as this must have afforded Nepos frequent opportunities for that ¹
moral disquisition, that praise of the noble and the good, and
condemnation of the mean and wicked, in which he so much
delighted. At the request of Atticus, as Nepos himself tells ns
(Octo, 3, end), he wrote ι detailod life of Cato the Censor3 ιιι we

„ gether from ι passage in Gellius (xv. 28), that he was the author

also of a biography of Cicero. It seems not nnlikely that he
composed besidesa treatiso on geography, and occasionally wrote
poctry. But of all these, either nothing remeius, or only a few
small fragments, which barely convey an idea of the nature of
the works of which they formed parts she most ambitious of
the literary productione of our author, and the only one of which
a large portion has been preserved, is that eutitled Dc Viris Illus-
trt'boa His plan was to give a briei biographical sketch of the most
distinguished men of all natione ιιι ages, but more especially
Greeks aud Romans. me lives were divided into books, each of
which embraced a particular class of eminent men. Of these
books there were at least sixteen, since Gharisius, a grammarian
of tho fourth or fifth century after Christ, refers to the sixteenth
(p..113‚ ed. Putsoh.) Several of the titles of the different categories
are known-namely, Dc Idocelleotibos Imperatoriboa, De H ararica,
Dc Begoes, Dc Poetis, and Do Gromowticrs. For each of these
classes or categorica thero were probably-in regard to some we
know it-two books, tho onc containing the lives of Romans, the
