other those of Greeks or other foreigners.1 Of thia comprehen-
sive work, we possess thebook Dallaecellentrbua Ducibuallnterorum
Gentium complete, along with tho lives of (lato and Atticus from
the book Do Heorta Lancia and a few fragments. The book
Da Nocdlootihaa Dacihua Estcrorom Gentium contains lives of
eighteen Greek generals, one Thracian, one Persian, and two
Carthaginians, along with a very brief account of some of the
most eminent monarche. The period of time comprehended
extends from the Persian invasione oi Graece, in the beginning of
the fifth century nc, ιο the death of Hannibal, in the beginning
of the second century mc. Some eminent Greek commanders,
who flourished during this period, are not mentioned by Nepos,
but, upon the whole, his list is satisfactory. The order of the
lives is not strictly chronologica13 but the deviations are not of
much importanca

In judging of the velue of the work, and of the character
of Nepos as a historian, we must bear in mind that his principal
object in the Vitae Moratum Virorum, as well as the Exemplo,
was in all probability ιο convey moral instruction to his
countrymori. He had it in view, not so much ιο describe the
exploits οι hia heroes with minute accuraoy, as ιο depict their
virtues or their vices, and impress his readers with a feeling of
moral approbation or disapprobation accordingly. Keeping this
chief object of Nepos in mind, wo can account for and excuse
various things in the work, which, judged by the standard that we
commonly apply to a heatise on any historical subject, must be
pronounced decided blemishes. For example, we can thus excuse
his occasionally stating incidente in a person’s life, notin chrono-
logical order, bnt simply as they occurred ιο his memory; his
narration of anecdotos somewbat beneath the dignity of ordinary
history, bnt illustrative of traits of character3 and his almost
entire neglect, in a few cases, of historical detail, for tbe sake of

dwelling upon moral features. rho most lenient critic, however,
cannot venture to defend gross inaccuracy in regard to historical
statementa which we not unfrequently find in Nepos. 0ur author
seeum ιο have been totally unable to weigb the respective trust·
werthiness of conflicting accounts ; and in some instances, where
such presented themselves in his authorities, he attempta to
reconcilo them, in a simple-minded bnt utterly unphilosophical
