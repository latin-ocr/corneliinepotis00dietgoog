manner, by throwing the various storias into one, which is, of
course, inconsistent and unsatisfactory. So great is the careless-
ness of Nepos throughout, that in the life of Datames, which he
bas related more fully than any other ancient writer, and in
regard to which, therefore, we can but seldom consult a more
trustworthy historian, we are unable to reposo implicit belief in
bis testimony. We may believe in the accuracy of the general
outlines, but cannot free ourselvcs of the conviction, that in the
details there are probably not a few mistakes. Whether this
inaccuracy arose from natural indolence, and indisposition to
careful research, or from hastam the composition of the work, it
is greatly to be regretted. In forming his opinion of the character
of his heroes, Nepos is too onesided They are either models of
excellence, or specimens of nnmitigated baseness3 and Dion is
perhaps the only one in this work in whom he sees a mixture of
good and evil. In style, our author is generally simple. He
loves short, clear sentences, though occasionally, for the sake of
effect, he expands his thought into a round rhetorical period. In
construction, he is commonly pure 3 but there are a few ceses—for
instance, aaa dahac, followed by the accusative with the infinitive,
instead of qaia (see Praefatio, p. l, n. l), and aarum cst, ut (Herm l,
beginning)—in which he varies from the ordinary mode of
expression in good writers. Anmoluths—thet is, sentences which
end in a manner unsuitable to their commencement, and the
different parts of which are therefore inconsistent in construction
-are of very frequent occurrence, and prove that the author's
carelessness in regard ιο research extended also to composition.
In his choioe of single words, likewise, Nepos is generally quite
classical, but occasionally we meet with words of a colloquial
kind, unsuitable for serious writing, and admitted probably
through inadvertence. Such are impraesentiarum (Hane. 6),
medvana and eacdvcraam (fhraayb. 2, end, and Themist. 3, end),
and others. As was ιο be expected in a book treating principally
of Greeks, and in the composition of which the author must
constantly bave had Greek authorities before him, there are
numerous Graecisms in the forms of declension, and sometimes
in the words. Thus, for example, we have M arcthoac (M iit. 4),
Salamina and Troezena (flmmmt. 2, end), trieris for triremis
(Aba. 4), and citharizare (lipom. 2, beginning.) N epos’s careless-
ness in composition appears not merely in broken constructione,
as was mentioned above, but also in the disagreeable repetition
of the same words, where a change in the expression was quite
practicable, without injury to the sense. This occurs very fre-
quently, and some of the most offensive cases are pointed out in
the notes. But though Nepos can by no means ba placed, either
in regard to substance or style, among writers of the first class,
