rum institutis judicari, non admirabuntur¹ nos in Graiorum

f ¹ Equivalent here to the simple mirabuntur. Graii is apoetical form
or rocca

¹The adjective, permanan, means generally ‘one who has the same
father and mother3' but sometimes, as here, ‘one born of the same
father, but not of the same mother ;' and sometimes, again, ‘one born
of the same mother, but not of the same father.' The force of sororem

adoptive sister, or a cousin (soror potmoetis.)

³‘Slnce‚' ‘seeing that! Tffis gives the reason why it was not

a change from a place to the people are very numerous.

the many persons who, in the course of the day, visit the primm loeas

corresponding signification.
