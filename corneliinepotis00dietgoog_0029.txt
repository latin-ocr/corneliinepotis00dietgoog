contentio, utrum moenibus defenderent,l an obviam irent
hostibus acieque decernerent.2 Unus Miltiades maxime
nitebatur,³ ut primo quoque tempore⁴ castra fierent. Id si
factum esset, et civibus animum aocessurum,⁵ cum viderent
de eorum virtute non desperari,6 et hostes eadem re fore
tardiores, si animadverterent7 audere adversus se tam
exiguis copiis³ dimicare.

ὅ. Hoc in tempore⁹ nulla civitas Atheniensibus auxilio
fuit practer Plataeenses.¹⁰ Ila mille misit militum.¹¹ Itaque
horum adventu decem milia armatorum completa sunt;
quae manus mirabili flagrabat pugnandi cupiditate. Quo
factumest ut plus quam collegae Miltiades valeret. Ejus
ergo auctoritate impulsi, Athenienses copias ex urbe edux-

1Defenderent here is equivalent to arcerent, ‘should ward off?
Supply hostes from the following, hostibus.

1(ξίᾼιίξί settle the matter by a pitohed battle‚' as opposed to
sirmis es.

3Τὶιίε verb well expresses the eamestness end pertinacity with
which Miltiades supported his opinion. The imperfect, too, implies
that he spoke again and again on the subject. Grom. ἓ 335.

⁴ A peculias phrase, equivalent to praem primam, ‘ as soon as possible.'

⁵‘That courage would be added,' or ⁴ that additional courage would

be given.' Το govern this clause, supply the idea of dicebat from the
preceding, aiebatur.

⁶ An impersonal construction ; literally, ‘that it was not despaired'
-that is, ‘that there was no despair) In this mode of construction,
tha mere action of the verb is expressed, without its being attributed
to any definite subject. Were the verb put in the active voice, and a
subject supplied, the expression would be praetores aon desperare.

⁷Supp1yeos or Athenienses. In cases where the subject of the
governing and of the governed verb is the same, the omission of the
accusative of the pronoun before the infinitiva is common and quite
justifiable; but in this case, where animaduerterent and eadem have
different subjecte, it is decidedly reprehensible. See Grem. 5 385.

⁸The ablative here may be accounted for as an ablative absolute,
‘while their forces were so small' However, it may be observed‚ that
the Latin authors frequently, in speaking of military operations, use
the ablative alone, though properly cum is required This may bc an
instance of the practice.

⁹ Tempus here means not simply ⁴ time‚' but ‘critical state of affairs'
Hence the proposition. Grem. ἕ 308, note l.

1⁰ Plataeae was a town in Boeotia

n ln this sentence of four words there are two peculiarities. Fores
misit we expect Ii miserunt, but Nepos construes as if he had said ealle
deitas praeter (civilatem) Plataeensem or Plerlceensium. Mille militam
should, according to ordinary usage, be mille milites. Mille, however,
is here, and in soma other cases, treated as a substantive, which its
plural always is Grcm. ἕ 104, note; Elem. Grcm. 88.
