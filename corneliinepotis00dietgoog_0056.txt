Qua victoria elatus plurima miscere² coepit et majora cou-

quarum auxilio Persae erant victi.

³ Nepos does not tell the story in such a way as to bring out clearly
where the crime or the folly 01 Pausaniae lay. The Greeks (not
Pausanias, as posuisset would lead us to believe) dedicated from the
Persian spoils a golden tripod to Apollo at Delphi. Upon this Pau-
sanias caused to be en ved an arrogant couplet, wherern he ascribes
all the glory to himseii.8 The couplet has been preserved to ns by
ibuoydides, and is to the following effect: ‘Pausanias leader 01 the
Greeks, after destroyin the host oi the Parsiana, dedicated this
memorial to Phoebus.' e lines were written for him hy Simonides,
