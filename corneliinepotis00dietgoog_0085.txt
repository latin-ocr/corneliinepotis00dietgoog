sui subalare telum1 eripuit. Namque erat cum eo quidam
ex Arcadia⁹ hospes, qui nunquam discedere voluerat. Hunc
sequi se jubet, et id quod³ in praesentia vestimentorum init
arripit. His iu ignem ejectis,⁴ flammae vim transiit. Quem
ut barbari incendium effligisse viderunt, telis eminus missis
interfecerunt, caputque ejus ad Pharnabazum retulerunt. At
mulier, quaecum eo vivere consuerat, muliebri sua veste
contectum aedificii incendio mortuum cremavit, quod ad
vivum interimendum erat comparatum.⁵ Sic Alcibiades
annos circiter quadraginta natus,⁶ diem obiit supremum.

ll. Hunc infamatum a plerisque tres gravissimi historici⁷
summis laudibus extulerunt: Thucydides,⁸ qui ejusdem aetatis
fuit, Theopompus, qni post aliquanto natus, et Timaeus; qui
quidem du0⁹ maledicentissimi, nescio quo modo‚¹⁰ in illo uno

1 Sulalare telam is a short dagger, which cau convenieutly be carried
sab olo, ‘nuder the arm? Empoit—namely, from the sheath‚ or from
the place where it lay.

⁹The ceutral division oi Peloponnesus. It was chiefly a pastoral
district, aud the simple and faithful character of the people rs much

Δ celebrated in song.

³striot1y id vestimentorum quod .· Grom. ἓ 275, a. But the genitive
is drawn into the relative clause.

⁴‘Having thrown these out'—namely‚ out of the room where he
was. He thus formed, as it were, a sort of bridge over the flames.

ὕ ‘ Burned him when dead (that is, his dead body) in the fire which
had been prepared to consume him alive)

⁶ This is a mistake. He must have been about forty-six. As to this
use of notos, see Gram. ἓ 256, u. 3; Elem. Grom. 276.

⁷‘Three very eminent historiens? Gratas is often thus used figu-
ratively of a man whose character or abilities give him some sub-
stantial importunos. Historiam is very rarely used as a substantive
in the best age oi the language. A circumlocution was generally
employed-such as ilistoriarum scriptor, remia gestorum praesumatur.

⁸As to rlhucydides, see Themisi. 9, p. 28, n. 12. Theopompus (born
about 378, died probably about 300 Β. c.) was a native oi the island of
Chios, aud wrote, among other works, a continuation of tha history of
Thucydides. Timacus (horu about aab, died about 254 ac.) was a
native of Tauromenium, in Sicily, and wrote a history of that island.
Neither the work of Theopompus nor that of Timaeus is extant.
Aliquanto here may bc translated hp ‘not very loug:‘ he was born

about twenty-six years after the deat of Alcibiades. To acius supply
fait from the preceding clause.

⁹That is, the two last mentioned. Both oi them, especially Timacus,
were notoriously raabdici, ‘fond of speaking evil of others*

1⁰ ‘ I know not how.' Nescio is very often thus used iu semi-adverbial
phrases, as dieii neseio id, ‘he said something, Ι do not know what'
—that is, somethingt ' ¹ g, not worth remembering.
