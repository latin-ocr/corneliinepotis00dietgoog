sine fortuna ponderanda sit, dubito an¹hunc primum omnium
ponam: illud sine dubio; neminem huie praefero fide, con-

the substantive but seldom has; it generally refers to birth. Praecur-
rere, ‘to surpass,' a metaphor taken from a rece. It forms its perfect

⁵Generally‚ when ille and lio are opposed, ille means ‘the former‚’
the person furthest removed, and bic, ‘the latter‚' the person nearest.
