perduxit. Quem Dion adeo admiratus est atque adamavit,
ut se ei totum traderet. Neque vero minus Plato delectatus
est Dione. Itaque cum a tyranno crudeliter violatus esset,
quippe quem² venumdari jussisset, tamen eodem³ rediit,

incidit Dionysius. Quo cum gravi⁴ conflictaretur, quaesivit

²This is a very harsh construction, the subject in the first clause
being Plato, in the relative clause, Dionysius. Quippe qai eum cenum
dari jussisset, in which case the relative relers to tpronno, would have
been much better. 'lhe story, which is not at al a probable one, is
that Plato was sold as a slave, but afterwards set at liberty by his
master.

³Eodem, adverb, ‘to the same place,⁹ Syracuse. This return did
not take place till alter the death of Dionysius the Elder.

⁴The pravi is in a manner in apposition to the relative: ‘under

⁷In English, we speak oi children being born ‘to' the father, and
‘of’ the mother. n Latin, likewise, aa is usually applied to the
