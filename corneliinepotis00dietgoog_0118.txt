Iphicrate desertus esset.¹ Populus acer, suspicax, ob eamque
rem mobilis, adversarius,⁹ invidus (etiarn potentiae in crimen
vocabantur), domurn revocat: accusantur proditionis.³ Hoc
judicio damnatur Timotheus, lisque ejus aestimatur centurn
talentis.⁴ Ille, odio ingratae civitatis coactus, Chalcidem⁵ se
eontulit.

4. Hujus post mortem6 cum populum judicii sui poeniteret,
multae novem partes⁷ detraxit, et decem talenta cononem,
filium ejus, ad muri quandam partem reficiendam jussit
dare. In quoss fortunae varietas est animadversa. Nam
quos aurs Oonon muros ex hostium praeda⁹ patriae resti-
tuerat, eosdem nepos curn summa ignominia familiae ex sua
re familiari reficere coactus est.

Timothei autem moderatae sapientisque vitae oum ple-
raque¹⁰ possimus proferre testimonia, uno erimus contenti,
qnod ex eo facile conjici poterit, quam carus suis fuerit.

¹According to another historiar, the case was somewhat different.
Chares wished the other commandere to engage during a storm, and,

² ‘Inclined to look with a hostile eye on everything.’ This is hyper·
bolical‚ of course.

³Iphiorates aud Menestheus were tried first, iu 355 rac, and
acquitted. Timotheus was tried the following year.

¹¹ This trial took place in 373 nc, and the accusation was ou the
ground, that Timotheus had been dilatory in the conduct ο1 an expe·
dition with which he had been intrusted, to aid the Gorcyraeans
against Lacedaemon. As he must have been about forty years of age
at that time, Nepos either is mistaken in calling him an adolescentulas,
or the diminutive means the same as adolescens. Properly speaking, a
man could not be designated au adolescens after thirty, but we not
uufrequently find older men so styled. Cicero calls himself odolescen-
tulas when twenty-seven years ο1 age; and the historian Sallust thus
designatas Caesar, though he was at the time thirty-six years old.
