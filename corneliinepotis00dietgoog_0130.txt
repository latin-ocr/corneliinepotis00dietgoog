bellurn, cum nihilo magis, ne quarn suspicionem illi praeberet

susceperant, contineri viderentur.

¹ 11. ld* curn satis se confirmasse arbitratus est, certiorem
facit Datamen tempus esse majores exercitus parari‚⁵ et
bellum cum ipso rege suscipi; deque ea re, si ei videretur,
quo loco vellet, in colloquium veniret.⁶ Probata rc, collo-
quendi tempus sumitur locusque, quo conveniretur. Huc
Mithridates cum uno, oui maxime habebat fidem, ante aliquot
dies7 venit, compluribusque locis separatim gladios obruit,
eaque loca diligenter notat. Ipso autem colloquii die utrique‚⁰

deinde ipsi sunt congressi. Hie cum aliquamdiu in colloquio
fuissent, et diversc¹⁰ discessissent, jamque procul Datames

1Two negatives in Latin commonly neutralise each other, and are
equivalent to an affirmative. Here, however, the nihilo-aeque form
a strong negation‚ which we cannot express in translation. Neque—
neque must be rendered by ‘either-or,' whilst nihilo retains its force.
This verb well expresses the hypocritical nature of the friendship:
he ‘wore' it about him like a eloah
³In regard tc the use of erpa, see Aias. 4, . 58, n. l.
⁴ Id is, in a general way, ‘the notion or idea that they were bound
together by a common hatred to the king.'
As tc tempus est with the infinitive‚ see Graan. ἓ 396, 11. 3
⁶'rhe subject circuiret is Datames, and the imperfect subjunctive
here represents the imperative of direct speech. Gram. ἓ 388, n. 25
Elem. (r'rcm 362, end.
⁷In ordinary usage ante aliquot dies means ‘a few days ago,' whilst
in stating something that happened before another in a narrative
relating to past ages, aliquot diebus anie is the proper expression.
Nepos's use of the former mode of expression here must be viewed as
apiece of negligenoe. ‘Before' here means ‘before the time fixed for
the conferenoe. We may observa that the reason assigned by Mithri·
dates for requesting an interview with Datames cannot have been, as
Nepos says, a wish to discuss the propriety of giving up the system
which they had hitherto pursued—uamely, harassing the provinces of
the neighbouting satraps—aud of declaring open war against the king
himself Such an idea on the part cf two small dynasta would have
lplqen quite preposterous. Some other object than this must have been
e e ·
⁸ cr uterque. The use of the plural in reference to two individuals
is rare in good writers. Its proper use is collective, ‘both partica'
f⁹ffhat is, the two generals. To mitani supply clauos suoram, ‘some
o t eir men.'
¹⁰ ‘ Different ways' Dirrersi would be more in accamanus w'xbxtbxs
common mode of expression.
