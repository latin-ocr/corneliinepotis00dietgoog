7. Sine dubio post Leuctricam pugnam Lacedaemonii se
nunquam refecemnt, neque pristinum imperium recupera
runt, cum⁶ interim Agesilaus non destitit, quibuscunque
rebus posset, patriam juvare. Nam cum praecipue Lacedae-
monii indigerent pecunia, ille omnibus qui a rege⁷ defecerant
praesidio fuit 3 a quibus magna donatus pecunia patriam
sublevavit. Atque in hoca illud in primis fuit admirabile,

, possession of the hill were implicated in the scheme to desert.
