xvrn. neumas. 149

ab anno vicesimo, nti supra ostendimus, septem annos
Philippo apparuisset,l tredecim apud Alexandrum eundem
locum obtinuisset, in his unum⁹ equitum alae praefuisset,
post autem Alexandri Magni mortem imperator exereitus
duxisset, summosque duces partim repulisset, partim inter·
fecisset, captus non Antigoni virtute sed Macedonum pery'urio,
talem³ habuit exitum vitae. In quo⁴ quanta omnium fuerit
opinio eorum, qui post Alexandrum‘Magnnm reges sunt
appellati, ex hoc facillime potest judicari, quod nemo, Eumene
vivo, rex appellatus est, sed praefectus, iidem post hujus
occasum statim regium ornatum nomenque sumpserunt,⁶
neque, qnod initio praedicarant, se Alexandri liberis regnum
servare, praestare voluerunt, et, uno propugnatore sublato,
¹ quid sentirent apemerunt Hujus sceleris⁶ principes iuemnt
Antigonus, Ptolemaeus, Seleucus, Lysimachus, Cassander.
Antigonus autem Eumenem mortuum propinquis ejus sepe·
liendum tradidit. Hi militari honestoque funere, comitante
toto exercitu, humaverunt,⁷ ossaque ejus in Cappadociam ad
matrem atque uxorem liberosque ejus deportanda curarunt.

which is the natural connection, then the author is wrong, lor he has
merely stated generali (chapter l) that Eumenes was a perodoleecea·
talas when he entered lhilip's service. Uti mpro ostendimus, however,
may be connected with what lodows, septem annos, in which case it is
correct. See chapter l, near the end.

l‘Had attended upon '—that is, had been secretary to. ‘lhe verb
not pnfreqnentlyhos this signification, and hence the name of those
puplppgppptppnpqprqqppqllppqupqlppqpmThis agrees with what is stated
in chapter 1, end: nobissimo ternpore, eet.

³The sentence begins with sic, and therefore talem is unneeessary;
but many words have intervened.

⁴ ‘ln the ease ol whom,' ‘in regard to whom?

⁶'l'his is an error. Anti onus and the others did not amorne the
name of king till a considerable number ol ears later, after the
children of Alexander had been murdered e death oi Eumenes
had no influence upon their taking this step.

eNamely, the throwing off allegiance to Alexander's sons.

⁷The body ol Eumenes was bumed; then the ashes, as usual, wore
interred, and the bones, which resisted the flames, were sent to his
mother. macana toto canatur this, considering the hatred that the
great majority of the soldiers bore to Eumenes, is very improbable.
