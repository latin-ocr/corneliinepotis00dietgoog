Demades was an Athenian 011101· of great ability but no principle. lu

322 ac. Antipater, the regent of Macedonia, defeated the con ederatc
Greeks at cronon, in Thessaly, aud Demades, Phocion, aud some
others, were seut by the Atheniens to treet with the conqueror. They
agreed among other things, not, 11 Nepos says, to surrender the city,
bnt to receive 1 Macedonian garrisou into the port 01 Munychie, 1
condition which Phocion strove, bnt in vain, to induce Antipater to
dispensa with. Hereupcu Demosthenes (the greatest orator and one
of the noblest meu of antiquity), and the other leaders of the auti·
Macedonian party in Athens, took to flight, aud upon the propcsal of
Demades, the people sentenced them to death. From this sketch one
01 two errors iu Nepos's statement may be perceivcd

⁸These words 111 emphatic, 11 their position shews: ‘it was by the
support and aid of Demosthenes that he had monnted to that position
which he occupied* Aspera aliquem is ‘to promote a person, obtain
101 him honour end influcuce.' .

⁴ The subject of subornaret is Demosthenes, aud eam refers 10 Phocion.
This change 01 the subject is awkward, but there ore other iustenoes
of the same kind in Nepos As to Chares, see Chabrias, 3, p. 94, 1. 7.
Sutomare is strictly ‘to furnish secretly,' a force which aab sometimes
has iu composition. Here we must understand the meanin to bs,
that Demosthenes privately leut his influeuce iu favour 01 Phocion,
when opposing the proceedings of Chares. Nepos's statemeuts here
are improbable. Phocion was considerably older than Demosthenes,
aud had ac uired some reputatiou before the latter entered publio life.
Moreovcr, emosthenes aud Chares, instead 01 being enemies, were
politically allied, notwithstanding the coutrast iu their characters.
