XXI. DE REGIBUS. 163

De quibus quoniam satis dictum putamus, nou incom-

modum¹ videtur non praeterire Hamilcarem et Hannibalem, ’

quos et animi magnitudine et calliditate omnes in Africa
natos praestitisse constat.

the mode of expression, we should suppose the ipse Ptolemaeus to bc
Ptolemy Ceraunus, mentioned in the preceding sentence, whereas it
really refers to his father, Ptolemy Soter, who, during his litetime, gave
up the throne of Egypt to his younger son, Ptolemy Philadelphus. ln
th'e second place, Ptolemy Soter was not killed by this son Philadelphus,
but, on the contrary, lived in great harmony with him from the time
of his abdication till his death, which took place in 283 rac. Nepos

robahly consounds the first of the Ptolemies with his grandson,
{tolemy Euergetes, who was said by some to have been poisoned by

rs son.

1 ‘N ot unseasonable‚' ‘not improper '·-that is, ‘very proper.'
