consiliis segregari vidisset, tempore⁴ dato adiit ad regem, eique
cum multa de fide sua et odio in Romanos commemorasset,

consisted merely in the success of his arms.

1Antiochus 111, king of Syria, sumamed the Great, reigned from
223 to 187 ac. Nam, at the be 'nning of this sentence, is obviously
intended to introduce a proci or rllustratiou cf the statement made iu
the end of the preceding chapter, that Hannibal never ccased, even
in his adversity, to cherish feelings of hatred against the Romans.
Consequently, instead of Namss-omm'um-potente'ssimus renAntioetos fnit:
hanc-incendit, eet, the logical mode of speaking would be, to throw the
two sentences into one, Nom-Antiochum, pai omniun-potentissimos
ren fuit, tento eupiditate incendit bellandi, eet. Nepos, however, desirous
to simplify the construction, divides the period, making what isin
realitya mere accessory and parenthetioal observation (qni—fnit) into a
septlenple by it⁸⁰if9⁹2f⁰r3⁰tting that the nom is in no way applicable to it.

³ Tomqndm ob ipsis corruptam belong closely to Hannibalem, though
, they are somewhat awkwardly separated from it. The order of con·

struction, therefore, is this: nt addace-rent Hannibalem, tamqnam ab ipsis

suspicionem (eum) sentire atio atque antea (⁶ was entertaiuing di erent
sentimenta-with regard to the Romans-from those which he had
formerly avowed') Addueere aliquem alicui s'n suspicionem, is ‘to bring
oue into suspicion with another,' ‘to make one he suspected by
another.' One means adopted by the ambassadors for effecting their
eud, was to visit and converse with Hannibal often, thus leading the
{ing to thind that his old hostility to their natica had in some way
