accepissem, atque ab eo petere coepissem, ne dubitaret ducere,
tum ille “Faciam'' inquit, “si mihi fidem, quam postulo,
dederis.'’ Simul me ad aram adduxit, apud quam sacrificare
instituerat, eamque, ceteris remotis, tenentem jurare jussit·
uunquam me in amicitia cum Romanis fore. Id ego jusju-
randum patri datum usque ad hanc aetatem ita conservavi,
ut nemini dubium esse debeat, quin reliquo tempore eadem
mente sim futurus. Quare, si quid amice de Romanis
cogitabis, non imprudenter feceris, si me celaris31 cum

substantive is very irregularly thrown immediately under the govern-
meut of the comparative minor, leaving natm iu a manner quite uncon·

that Hannibal was at this time under twenty· ve: he was in his

⁵Saguntum (now Murviedro, a corruption of mori cetera), a town
situated south of the Ebro, aud not far from the sea Foederatom,
‘allied' namely, with the Romans. The feeling of Nepos as a Roman
was, that Saguntum was allied ‘with us ;' aud, this being well known
to his countrymeu, for whom, in the first instance, he was writing, he
does not consider it necessary to state the fact fully. ctam must not
be taken here as exactlyequivalent to urbs, for this is a use of the word
almost exclusively coufiued to later Latinity. 'ibe distinction is this:

tione, a large body of meu living together under the same govern-
ment, ‘a state) Hence it is evident that an urbs, iu the strict sense,
