Hannibalem domum et Magonem revocarunt. Huc ut rediit,
praetor factus est,³ postquam rex fuerat anuo secundo et
vicesimo. Ut enim Itomae consules, sic Carthagine quotannis
annui bini reges creabantur. In eo magistratu pari diligentia
se Hannibal praebuit, ac fuerat in bello. N amque effecit ex
novis vectigalibus, non solum 1114 01101 pecunia, quae Romanis
ex foedere penderetur, sed etiam superesset, quae in aerario
reponeretur. Deinde anno post praeturam, M. Claudio,
L. Furio, consulibus, Roma legati Carthaginem vencnmt.
Hos Hannibal ratus sui exposcendi gratia missos, priusquam
his senatus daretur,⁵navem ascendit clam, atque 111 Syriam
ad Antiochum profugit. Hac re palam facta, Poeni naves

hut, if we trust his account, it is evident that the magistrate whom hc
styles praetor bad to do with the administration 01 civil affairs merely,
like the practer orbanda at Rome, and that the word 11 1101 used here in
the same sense as in Mili. 4 (p. 9, n. 13), and other passa 01. The Cer-

Claudius and L Furius, which is said 0 little below to have been in
the year after his praetoreffip, was in 196 ac Hannibal is said to have
