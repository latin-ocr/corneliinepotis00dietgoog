about 204, died about 122 a c.),was a native of Megalopolis in Arcadia.
His principal work was a history of Rome (embracmg also a history 01
those natione with whom she came in contact), from the second Punic
War to the destruction of Carthago (146 ac.) A part of this at
work is extant, and is regarded as one of the most trustwort yof
ancient historica] recorda. Sulpicius Blitho is a writer quite unknown.
The consuls here mentioned follow in a regular series of years: M.
Claudius Marcellus and Q. Fabius Labeo, in 183 rac.; L Aemilius
Paullus (son of him who fell at Cannae) and Cn Baebius Tamphilus,
in 182 a. a, P. Cornelius Cethegus and 11 Baebius Tamphilus (brother
01 Cuneus), in 181 ac. Now in whicb of these years did Hannibal die?
lf cs were correct in saying that Polybius fixed the event in
182 c.‚ then 10 him wc sbould at once give credit. But both from a
fragment of Polybius’s own work, and from a statement made by the
Roman historias Livy, 11 appears pretty evident that Nepos, through
some oversight, dces not accuratelyquctePolybius's opinion, and that
that great authority agrees with Atticus in placing the death iu 183ac.
This, therefore, may be taken as the correct date.
