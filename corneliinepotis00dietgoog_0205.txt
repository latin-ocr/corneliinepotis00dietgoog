historical work—called Origines, aa Nepos mentions in the next
sentence—there exist only fragments.

11n these two books, he probably related also the history of Rom
from the expulsion of King Tarquin down to the first Punic War, tint
history being in fact little more than a narration ol how the different
Italian States were gradually merged in the empire of Rome.

'Aa toPomicas, see Hamilc. l, p. 164, n. 2. Est-that is, is described.

‘Lusitania was spart of Hispania Ulterior (for the Romans divided
Hispania into Hespcnia OEtcrior and Ulterior). In 151 and 1⁵0 aa,
Servius Galba, aa praetor and propraetor, carried on war a 'nst tha
Lusitanians3 and in the latter year he contrived, by t ο bfflt
treachery, to get a great number of them into his power, aud had them
butchered In the following year he was called to account at Roma
for this outrage, and Cato—then in the last year of his life-attached
him most vehemently in the assembly.

praetore, dre, and what province each obtained, did not afterwards
mention these magistrates by name, but merely by their titios,

By nulla doctrina Nepos intimatos, that Cato merely stated faeta md
