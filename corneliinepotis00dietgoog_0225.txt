totam in eo volumine1 exposuerit, quo magistratus ordinanti
Nulla enim lex neque pax neque bellum neque res illustris
est populi Romani, quae non in eo suo tempore sit nauta
et, quod difficillimum luit, sic familiarum originem subtexuit,
ut ex eo clarorum virorum propagines possimus cognoscere.
Fecit hoc idem separatim in aliis libris, ut M. Bruti rogatu
lunium familiam³ a stirpe ad hanc aetatem ordine enume
raverit, notansqui a quoque⁴ ortus, quos honores, quibusque ·
temporibus cepisset, pari modo Marcelli Claudii de Marcel-
lorum, Scipionis Cornelii et Fabii Maximi Fabiorum et
Aemiliorum.i Quibus libris nihil potest esse dulcius iis, qui
aliquam cupiditatem habent notitiae clarorum virorum.
Attigit quoque poeticen, credimus, ne ejus expers esset
suavitatis. Namque versibus, qui⁶ honore rerumque gas-

1 This is the Annalis mentioned in Hanc. 13, on which see the note.

,²That is, mentioned in chronological order the names of the
pqnpppsgrqrplgpstpppgpgqfieqqhtylpprbm Juniis, ¹his full name being M.
Junius Brutus. Familia is strictly a subdividon of a parabatis
nevertheless sometimes used, as here, for yma itself.

⁴ Quoque is ablativa from quicque, whereas quibusque is for at quisue

iThese clauses, which are very elliptical, must be filled up thus:
pari modo Marcelli Claudii (coyata) de (familia) Marcellarum, Scipionis
Cornelii et Fabii Maximi (coyata de familia) Fabiorum ei Aemiliorum
(librum scripserit.) 'ibe omission of ds before (familia) Foliorum st
Aemiliorum is somewhat awkwardz compare thal. 3, p. 94, n. 7. In
Marcelli Claudii and Scipionis Cornelii the family name is put before
the gentile, aa occasionally. The Marcellus meant is probably C.
Claudius Marcellus, consul in the year 50 rac. The Sci io is P. σω.
nelina Scipio Nasica, afterwards, from his adoption by etellus Pius,
called Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, consul in 52 sc. Q. Fabius
Maximus was consul in 45 aa Both Scipio and Fabius were into.
rested iu the pens Aemilia, because of the two sous of L Aemilius
Paullus Macedonicus one was adopted into the family of the Scipios,
and the other into that of the Fabii Maximi.

fBefore qai supply de iis: Compare Diam 8, p. 86, n. 6. This
omission is somewhat harah, but Nepos probably intended to use not
exposuit, but some such expression as laudibus autulii, with which the
accusative eos would have been required

⁷ ‘Under the bust of each) It was customary for the Roman familia
to have busts of such of their ancestors as had held curule offiees set
up in the atrium, with suitable descriptiva legende (tituli) attached to
each. Atticus, who had uo aucestors so dignilied, appears from this

passage to have adorned his house with fi ures oi the most reuowned
Romans, to whatever family they belonged
